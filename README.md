# Chatter

**What is Chatter?**

Chatter is a one-to-one messaging application accessed through the browser. It was built to test out the NextJS 13 App Router, so it is not fully finished.

**What technologies were used?**

Next.js, NextAuth, SWR, Prisma, Pusher Channels, Tailwind CSS, Formik, Docker

**What can be improved?**
+ Limit the amount of information sent to users (Emails, etc.)
+ Allow users to decline new chat sessions rather than being forced to join.
+ Implement credentials sign-in for users who don't want to use Google or GitHub.
